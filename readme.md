# Introduce

The Makepython Lora transceivers feature the LoRaTM long range modem that provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity whilst minimising current consumption.

# RadioLib Example

## send_and_receive.ino

A demo for communicating with the standard Makerfabs LoraNode (MaLora).

All Lora Nodes use this Lora library: [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib)

**It is recommended to install from Arduino Library Manager and select the library version 4.6.0. RadioLib libraries after 5.0 need to add "RADIOLIB_" before some macro definitions.**

The current firmware is developed in RadioLib 4.6.0.

## MaLora

**MaLora** is Makerfabs Loranode.

Makerfabs Lora Node is a series of products based on Arduino Pro Mini (328P) + Lora(SX127X). 

Like Relay, AC Dimmer, MOSFET, etc.

For easy to use, UID and generic instructions are provided. Some of them are our previous products, but have not added UID yet.

*We started with MicroPython, but the Lora library support was not good. There was also a failure to communicate with other Lora libraries. So we discontinued MicroPython maintenance, and subsequent Makerfabs Lora-related products use the agreed Lora library.*

## Test
